# Channel Feature

As a business we would like display a grid of channels.

The view has the title "MiniBox"

The channels can be found in the collection "channels"

When the data is loading display a loading view.

When loading the data errors display the try again view, tapping the button re-loads the data.

The "channels" collection has several documents that each contain the following json structure.

```
{
  "etag": "6nE8o",
  "id": "UC0zg",
  "brandingSettings": {
    "channel": {
        "title": "channel title"
    },
    "image": {
        "bannerExternalUrl" : "https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/L0hsY"
    }
  },
  "snippet": {
    "title": "title of object",
    "description": "description of object",
    "thumbnails": {
      "default": {
        "url": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIf8-rj-mo",
        "width": 88,
        "height": 88
      },
      "medium": {
        "url": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIf8-rj-mo",
        "width": 240,
        "height": 240
      },
      "high": {
        "url": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIf8K-mo",
        "width": 800,
        "height": 800
      }
    },
  }
}
```

Each channel will be represented by an image using snippet.thumbnails.medium.url of size 240 by 240.  Each channel will also have a title using snipped.title.

On tapping a channel, use the router dependancy to show a view called ChannelDetailView, pass to that view the channel title and firestore document id
